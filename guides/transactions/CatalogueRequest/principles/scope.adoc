= Scope

The intended scope for this {peppol} BIS includes business-to-government (B2G)
relationships. Although the BIS is a basis for an EDI agreement between two parties, it does not address all
business level details of such an agreement/contract.

The Pre-award Catalogue request is intended to be used in different tendering processes, such as:

. Call for Tenders ({bii3} Profile 53 - Call for Tenders)
  ** Most of the tendering information is in unstructured attachements
. Advanced Tendering ({bii3} Profile 34 - Advanced Call for Tenders with pre-award catalogue request)
 ** Most of the tendering information is found in structured elements
