== AdditionalDocumentReferences and Attachments

The `Enquiry` element should be build as follows:

. The first `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` within the `Enquiry` must have an `cbc:ID` having the attribute `schemeName` set to `ContractFolderID` and the value has to be the contract folder id.
. An `Enquiry` element can have multiple `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` refer to a LotsGroup, a lot or a part.
. The relation between `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` and `cac:Attachment` is done by a `cbc:XPath` element in the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference`.
. The `cbc:XPath` can only contain references to an `cac:Attachment` and has to match the following expression: `/Enquiry/cac:Attachment[number]` where number represents a 1-base index in the list of the attachments.
. All questions are placed in an `cac:Attachment` element. The attachment can have only one `cbc:Description` elements to ask a question and optionally refer to a file in the ASiC-e by using the `cbc:FileName` element.

The following are examples of combining questions in a transaction with different parts of the procurement procedure.

=== Common question about a procurement procedure

If you have questions only about the procurement procedure, a reference to the question in the attachments can be created directly in the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` with the `cbc:ID` having the `schemeName` set to `ContractFolderID`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
....
include::../files/TenderingQuestions-doc.xml[tags=contract-folder-id;question-contract-folder-id]
....
<.> The Contract Folder ID of the procurement procedure.
<.> A reference to an element where a question is located. The number in square brackets is the position in the list of attachments. The position starts with 1 (1-based indexing).
<.> The questions are placed in an attachment element.

=== A question about a group of lots of a procurement procedure

If you have questions about a group of lots, you have to add an `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` with an `cbc:ID` having an attribute `schemeName` set to `LotsGroup` and the value represents the Group of Lots ID.
Add as many questions as needed and refer the `cac:Attachment` with the `cbc:XPath` element.

[source,xml,indent=0]
....
include::../files/TenderingQuestions-doc.xml[tags=refer-question-group-of-lots;question-group-of-lots]
....
<.> The ID of the group of lots.
<.> A reference to a question.
<.> Refers to an optional file within the ASiC-e.
<.> Each attachment must have a question.

=== A question about several lots in a procurement procedure

If you have one question regarding several lots, you have to add an `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` for each lot containing an `cbc:ID` with an attribute `schemeName` set to `Lot` and a value representing the Lot ID.
Add an `cac:Attachment` with a question and refer this attachment with a `cbc:XPath` element in each `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` element.

[source,xml,indent=0]
....
include::../files/TenderingQuestions-doc.xml[tags=one-question-for-multiple-lots;question-for-multiple-lots]
....
<.> A reference to a lot.
<.> Another reference to a lot.
<.> References to the same question (note the same index in square bracket).

=== Reference to multiple attachments

It's possible to reference multiple `cac:Attachment` elements from an `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
....
include::../files/TenderingQuestions-doc.xml[tags=refer-multiple-attachments;multiple-attachments]
....
<.> A refernce to lot 6.
<.> Two XPath elements to reference the questions.
