= Message Level Response Principles

The Message Level Response is intended to inform the issuer of the following situations

1. The received notice contained errors according to the relevant conformance rules.
* The notice will not be processed any further.

2. The received notice passed the validation of conformance rules without any fatal errors.
* The notice will be processed further.

 3. The received notice is not validated for conformance but the receiver acknowledges that it has been received and identified as a business message.
* The notice will be processed further.

Furthermore, the transaction uses two levels of validation. The first one is the notice transaction itself, referenced with the `cbc:ID` tag.
The second level is the payload, which is referenced with the `cbc:UUID`.

In both levels can be errors which will be detailed through the transaction.

== The following errors are within the scope for a negative/rejecting Message Level Response:

* XML schema validation error
* Standard Compliance violations (e.g. empty elements not being allowed by UBL 2.1)
* Validation error of type fatal error
* Validation error of type warning. Warnings alone must NOT cause rejection of the business document (but they may be reported in addition to fatal errors)
* Wrong version of business document (Will be handled like validation error of type fatal error)

== The following errors are outside the scope of the message level response:

* Unknown sender (in scope of transport acknowledgement)
* Unknown receiver (in scope of transport acknowledgement)
* Wrong version of envelope (in scope of transport acknowledgement)
* XML schema validation error â€“ envelope (in scope of transport acknowledgement)
* XML not well formed (in scope of transport acknowledgement)
* Non supported encoding (in scope of transport acknowledgement)

* Wrong value (after database look-up) in reference fields (in scope of Business Level Response).
** Examples:
*** Wrong order number in invoice
*** Wrong project or customer reference in invoice
*** Wrong contract ID reference in catalogue
