== AdditionalDocumentReferences and Attachments

The `EnquiryResponse` element should be build as follows to answering questions:

. The ParentDocumentReference must have an `cbc:ID` having the attribute `schemeName` set to `ContractFolderID` and the value has to be the contract folder id.
. An `EnquiryResponse` element can have multiple `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` refer to the procurement procedure, a LotsGroup, a lot or a part.
. Answers have to be put in an `cac:Attachment` element. The question to be answered has to be placed at the beginning of the answer. The attachment can have one or more `cbc:Description` elements or refer to a file in the ASiC-e by using the `cbc:FileName` element.
. Each `cbc:Description` element contains only a question with its answer.
. The relation between `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` and `cac:Attachment` is done by a `cbc:XPath` element in the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference`
. The `cbc:XPath` can only contain references to an `cac:Attachment` and has to match the following expression: `/EnquiryResponse/cac:Attachment[number]` where number represents a 1-base index in the list of the attachments.

The following are examples of combining question and its answer in a transaction with different parts of the procurement procedure.

=== Answer a clarification request

If you have to answer a clarification request, a reference to the question in the attachments can be placed in the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` with the `cbc:ID` having the `schemeName` set to `ContractFolderID`.

=== Respond with a file

If an additional file should be sent to clarify an answer, it is possible to refer to an attachment pointing to a file within the ASiC-e.
