The {name-profile} describes a process providing electronic messaging support for the business process to publish a prior information notice, a contract notice or a contract award notice. The profile is executed between a contracting body or his representative and a publication body to announce business opportunities and contract awards in public procurement procedures. The key aspects covered by this BIS are:

* The electronic message exchange from the contracting body or his representative to publish a notice at the services provided by a publisher.
* The association of a notice to the message following the syntax provided by the UBL document schemas: {ubl-pin}, {ubl-cn}, {ubl-can}.
* The formatting of that notice according the rules described in {eforms-specs} maintained by the Publication Office.
* The possibility for the publisher to validate the notice, to request/suggest corrections to the notice, to approve its publication and to announce its publication date.
* The association of notice metadata to facilitate PEPPOL eTendering processes such as P001 - Procurement Procedure Subscription.


The purpose of this document is to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the notification and tendering process based on these formats.
